# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis using R

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

* Vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle and AWD provide non random amount of variance. The maximum random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_length
* Since p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11), the slope is not equal to zero
* The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 72% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model
